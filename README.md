## 🧠 Why I Built This

I was curious about how file compression works — especially **how much space is actually saved per file** during zipping. That curiosity led me to build this fully client-side tool that not only zips your files/folders but also gives you **a clear breakdown of what’s going on inside the archive**. Think of it like a "Zip Analyzer".
